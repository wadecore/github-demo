GOALS:
 - Get username approved for ROS wiki
 - Set up Docker to run website for ROS and Turtlebot marketing page testing
 - Get comfortable enough with Git to actually touch something that belongs to someone else

SUCCESSFUL ACTIONS:
 - Username approved for ROS Wiki
 - Upgraded to Windows 10
 - Installed Docker
 - Installed ROS Kinetic Container to Docker
 - Installed ROS Indigo Container to Docker

LIMITATIONS:
 - Lacking basic understanding of some aspects of ROS operation.
 - Docker causes brain to melt with awe
 - Terrified that I somehow forked the Turtlebot website and I have no idea when or how
